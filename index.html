    <h1>Why Every Business Needs A Website ?</h1>
    <p>Yes, every business needs a website here is the reason!

      Just Imagine, you invested some big amount and opened your own construction firm where you will provide all types of construction services in various cities. And also opened a new office and printed brochures, business cards and shared some with your family and friends. Yes, I agree you may get a few references also from friends. But the conversion rate is less.
      
      The one who actually looking for the exact service you are providing will be searching on the internet. They will be browsing for the best construction company in Bangalore or your city name, near me, or with certain other features.
      
      Ok fine! you have added your company google my business page and you gave a phone number too where people can contact you.
      
      But if he is searching at midnight and your working hours is till 7 or 8 pm then he will never call you. Even if he made a decision to call you in the morning, then he definitely wants to know what kind of work you do? what are the works you have already done? Will you also provide interior design service?
      
      Now people want proof of your work, before availing it.
      
      What if you own a website for your construction firm and mention in-detailed services list on the website. What kind of works do you do, your completed projects ongoing projects. Then a customer who was searching for this service looks into your website and gets some trust and there will be a high chance of getting construction work from your company.
      
      Website is all about building trust with your customers, proving your existence in the current market. And connecting to them at any time and anywhere.</p>
