      <div class="importance-content">
        <h1>Why Every Business Needs A Website ?</h1>
        <p>
          Yes, every business needs a website here is the reason! Just
          Imagine, you invested some big amount and opened your own
          construction firm where you will provide all types of construction
          services in various cities. And also opened a new office and printed
          brochures, business cards and shared some with your family and
          friends. Yes, I agree you may get a few references also from
          friends. But the conversion rate is less. The one who actually
          looking for the exact service you are providing will be searching on
          the internet. They will be browsing for the best construction
          company in Bangalore or your city name, near me, or with certain
          other features. Ok fine! you have added your company google my
          business page and you gave a phone number too where people can
          contact you. But if he is searching at midnight and your working
          hours is till 7 or 8 pm then he will never call you. Even if he made
          a decision to call you in the morning, then he definitely wants to
          know what kind of work you do? what are the works you have already
          done? Will you also provide interior design service? Now people want
          proof of your work, before availing it. What if you own a website
          for your construction firm and mention in-detailed services list on
          the website. What kind of works do you do, your completed projects
          ongoing projects. Then a customer who was searching for this service
          looks into your website and gets some trust and there will be a high
          chance of getting construction work from your company. Website is
          all about building trust with your customers, proving your existence
          in the current market. And connecting to them at any time and
          anywhere.
